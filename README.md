## overview

Code based on https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-drizzle-and-react. I highly recommend you read through the tutorial as well. 

Built using truffle, drizzle, react, solidity, etc.

## Install

1. `npm install`
2. `cd client && npm install`

## Build

One terminal:

1. $ `truffle develop`
2. > `compile`
3. > `deploy`

That compiles sc's and buids into client dir
